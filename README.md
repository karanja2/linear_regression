#  Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

## Description

#### Variables in the dataset

Age, sex, bmi, region, children, region, 
smoker: whether the individual is a smoker or not, 
charges: the cost of insurance for the individual.

### Steps followed

* Check the shape of the dataset to determine the number of rows and columns
* Check for missing values and handle them appropriately
* Check the data types of the variables to ensure they are in the correct format
* Summarize the statistics of the numerical variables
* Visualize the distribution of the variables using histograms, density plots, and box plots
* Check the relationship between variables using scatter plots, pair plots, and correlation matrix
* Check the distribution of the categorical variables using bar plots and pie charts.




#    Linear Regression
## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs linear regression on a dataset. The goal of this analysis is to build a model that predicts the target variable based on one or multiple independent variables.

##Requirements
In order to run the Jupyter Notebook, you will need to have the following software installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Sklearn
- Data
The dataset used in this analysis is provided in a CSV file. The data contains information on the target variable and one or multiple independent variables. The data includes the following columns:Target variable:
The variable that we aim to predict Independent variable(s): The variable(s) that will be used to make predictions
## Linear Regression
The Jupyter Notebook starts by performing linear regression on the dataset. This includes:

- Importing the data into a Pandas DataFrame
- Cleaning the data and handling missing values
- Generating summary statistics for the data
- Visualizing the distribution of the data using scatter plots
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets
- Training the linear regression model on the training data
- Evaluating the model on the test data using mean squared error and R^2 metrics
- Plotting the regression line to visualize the model's performance
- Interpreting the coefficients of the linear regression model to understand the relationship between the independent variable(s) and the target variable.
## Conclusion
In the end, the Jupyter Notebook will provide a summary of the results obtained from the linear regression analysis, along with an interpretation of the model's coefficients. This information can be used to make predictions on new data, or to fine-tune the model to achieve better performance.
